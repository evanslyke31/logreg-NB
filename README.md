# logreg-NB
logistic regression and naive Bayes classification algorithms from scratch using c++ and R

This project show what R does under the hood to optimize its itself when performing machine learning algorithms. Compare the two R and cpp implementaions for both logistic regression and naive bayes to see for yourself. Hint: It does a lot

Also shows how fast C++ and R will run each algorithm
